'''
To solidify the concept of a three DataFrame merge, practice another exercise. A reasonable extension of our review of Chicago business data would include looking at demographics information about the neighborhoods where the businesses are. A table with the median income by zip code has been provided to you. You will merge the licenses and wards tables with this new income-by-zip-code table called zip_demo.

The licenses, wards, and zip_demo DataFrames have been loaded for you.
'''

# Merge licenses and zip_demo, on zip; and merge the wards on ward
licenses_zip_ward = licenses.merge(zip_demo, on="zip") \
            			.merge(wards, on="ward")

# Print the results by alderman and show median income
print(licenses_zip_ward.groupby("alderman").agg({'income':'median'}))
